                    <aritcle>
                        There is no greater beauty, inspiration or proof of Divine grace, than nature.
                        From the ever changing fresco in the sky, to the most vile bottom feeder, natue's beauty multifaceted.  
                        It is our responsibility to use the ingenuity we have been graced with, to take care of nature.

                    <article>
                        Everyone has some creative pursuit.  Mine is music.  Harmony and rhythm is what 
                        animates my spirit.  I also am familiar with multiple instruments.

                            <p>Portable, ancient in design and ethereal.  Emulating the sweet song of the songbird
                                and the mournful howls of the wind.

                    <aritcle>
                        Food is never really "good" unless you do it yourself. The cutting board is my
                        palette, your plate is my canvas.  I use the recipes I grew up with and continue to 
                        add to my collection.  I am quite fond of Italian and Vietnamese cuisine.
